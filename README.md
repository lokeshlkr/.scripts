# Inspiration
As a new linux user I break my install frequently and have to start from scratch. To facilitate that this repo is created. Apart from that the highlight of this repo is `shelp.py` this script facilitates in reducing the number of steps i have to take in doing regular tasks.   

# Overview
This is a set of linux settings, configs or utilities that I use personally. You are free to make use of any component you like in your configs.

# Disclaimer
This is developed on following platform, any deviations might need rewrite or possibly fail altogether
- Languages: Python 3.10, bash
- OS: archlinux-based
- DE: xfce4
- Editor: VSCodium

# Usage
The usage for this is very personal and nuanced, explaining things will involve basically exaplining each line of code. So ommiting that, you can email me if you have anything specific. 
You can most learn a lot of usage from `setup_new_install.sh` file under `autostart`.
After that most of the directory names are self explanatory.
Undestanding `shelp.py` will require you to read the code in it.
